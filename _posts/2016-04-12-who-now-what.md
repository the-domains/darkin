# Who Now What?

Time is an illusion

a mystic alluding

to eluding meanings

just as the seasons

dances with reasons

what curious recursions

curious these lines

how they tread on in time

written and read

remember what you said?

caught you from the stars

what's mine is ours

the hours go slow

and how did you sound

with the music all around

your eyes and hands

story weavers

dream makers

the humanity

the divinity

straight from the stars

and I know what you are
