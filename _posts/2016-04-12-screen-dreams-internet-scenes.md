# Screen Dreams Internet Scenes

Things have been changing

I'm seeing new things

when I go to mp3 sea

my screens have multiplied

my appetite rectified

but I'm still a primitive mind

trying to find my kind

things have been changing

minds on overdrive

scrutiny sharpened twice

still dancing under stars

but I whisper what

_is_

life?

and balance between abject terror

and blissful surrender

but now I'm chanting between my breathing

I know nothing

I know nothing

Just a piece of a part of some kind of art

and things have been changing.

Screens and dreams

People and scenes

I suppose I'm a summation and something in between.
