# The Same Ones as You

Pieces and parts  
life imitates art  
and my heart  
tell me what it's for  
because I'm feeling sore  
Is it meant for breaking?  
Will it make me free like lightning?  
I don't know what this is for  
you know there's so much lore  
explaining the stars  
and pieces and parts  
life imitates art
