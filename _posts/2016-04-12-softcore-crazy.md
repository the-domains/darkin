# Softcore Crazy

Something happened

where the anguish of language first bloomed

and why is what we ask

and find out about no inside or outside

symbolic logic, false prophets

but always the tides are changing

and it's such a terrible beauty

being only a momentary memory

and finding all these senses

all the messes

it's a terrible beauty.

And as you hold me the world spins

Minds spill over

while others drain

the form crumbles

some laughter echoes

eerily repeating

every moment bleeding

I feel a bit like I'm sinking

with all this thinking of thinking

goodbye, hello

is the man who is tall happy?

the man who is tall is happy

god bless humanity

fragmentary immortality

in the world of words

whispers of past lives

faintly in the mind
