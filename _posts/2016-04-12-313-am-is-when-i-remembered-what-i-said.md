# 3:13 AM is when I remembered what I said

We all know to question if our glass is half empty or half full

but if we take that glass and half it we can change the whole view

once a glass half full now a half glass full

now the leaves are shaking and it's a stream straight to heaven

nestled between your ear and the sound of the ocean

now you know your lover forever more

and what it really means to say goodbye

to a precious gaze in this maze

now you see life is full

of a terrible beauty

where nothing is sure if it's dreaming

and the moon eclipsed is just another eye closing

now you can look up at the sky and notice it's gleaming

the stars are shaking, into light they are breaking

such a beautiful sight

this world in the making

so go to the edge of the river with your glass overflowing

shed all your tears as rain for the falling

just let your heart beat in its motion

this time around

your tears are an ocean
