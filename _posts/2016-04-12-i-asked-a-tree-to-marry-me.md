# I asked a Tree to Marry Me

This isn't a negotiation

This is a cry born from isolation

All these people in my heart are probably hurting

maybe more than I am

and I want to do more than tell you

I want to live it with you

But we are people and have to choose

and I feel like the girl sitting in the shade of the fig tree

admiring all the choices to make

and I hope I don't wait while it withers away

I hope that one day I can get this all off my chest

and remind you that there is no God

but there is you and me

and others around, and that we can feel love ethereally

but that's about the only confession I'll make

about spooky action at a distance and quantum reality

and how you can play my heart strings

from miles and years away.

Perhaps my mistake is asking for one person to steal my heart

and hold it forever

when what I really want

is for everyone to realize that kisses aren't just for lovers

and if I brush your hair out of your eyes

you should just let your heart beat faster

and if it strikes your fancy to hold me

it's not something to hold back from me

we're just a bunch of monkeys

symbolically blabbering

about god knows what half the time

so maybe we should relax into it

and push the limits of affection

because I think we all now know

how lonely we all are.

but I'm just a romantic

a hopeless fanatic

a blabbering lunatic

but some call me a dreamer

and some call me a wizard

and one day I'll find you

in that room where we all get what we want

and I'll wait for you there my darling

in ageless abandon

because everything is the only thing worth living for

and I'll never stop sharing my illusions

that's where it all came from. That's the secret.

and someday soon an evening will illuminate

and you will see that Rumi was the caliphate

and there's nothing else to see

so it's ok

be with me

and let the snow fall

and the stars call

can't you remember

why we ever named forever?
