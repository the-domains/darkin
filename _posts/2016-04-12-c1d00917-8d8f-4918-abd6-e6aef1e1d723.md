For you I can lay the secrets

Of the past thousand years bare

I profess the whispers of trees

And empty my mind of all my dreams

No one believes me the things I see

Quick to make one word out of me

Another waste of time

Romantic, naive

I'd tell you that I love you

But you never believe

I almost don't myself

If it weren't for the smiles I see

The things that I dream

If it weren't for silent nights graced by a whispering breeze

I wouldn't believe

In timeless abandon

Our species disease

Sowed by promises the stars made long ago

You think love is held in the ego?

Don't be absurd

That kind of abandon can only be timeless

So I love you all

What can I say

When my lovers insist on fighting

It splits me like lightning

Humanity what can I say

Your wounds are tender

Your scars are hard

Your stories don't mix

I get it you're pissed

But I love you evermore

Even after your heart has been torn

So please stop this madness

I've had enough of you in caskets

We have plenty to do

I want to recreate the world

With you

Do you see yet what splits us in two?

Why must we insist

To not resist

The worst of things

Is it a cycle like the rain?

As inevitable as death?

Can't we rest and shed tears

Can't I hold you without fear?

I love you my dear

Because when things are clear

I know we have always been right here

Twirling in time

Being different people

But the rhyme still shines

And I'm going insane

I'd be committed by you

If I confessed what's on my mind

Rambling about love and sunshine

How there's not one thing more alive than any other

And my suspicion that we're actually all the same

Unconventional to say the least

But so was it to say there was a globe beneath our feet

So I sit here and pray

That one day it'll be obvious

And in the mean time I hold the rain

Because I promised to catch your tearsFor you I can lay the secrets
