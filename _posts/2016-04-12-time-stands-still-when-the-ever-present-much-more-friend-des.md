# Time stands still when the ever present much more friend descends

Here it is again

the shadow of creation

reminding me of the difficulties of delicacy

we all hold onto time

as much as our hearts can

Life is fleeting again I'm seeing

I'm sorry my Darling

for never telling you I miss you

Friends, I'm yearning for our time

to be intertwining

I forgot again that we're dealing

with finite kinds

lives in the making

before entropy makes its breaking

why is it that it seems we're fighting

against a force that's meant for taking

finite divinity

hold me

a spark in the dark

a brief emergence built up from the heart

Life, you tease me

What is it again we came here to gain?

God are you there?

What's your aim?

Ashes to Ashes

I feel like a flame

that knows its fortune

dancing for it all to begin again
