# Apocalyptic Thinking

Capture the rapture

now enraptured

to hold something larger than your palms

(now cold)

Humanity, fragility

a moment shared

we all cared

a force of nature

humankind unwinds

into an obvious moment in time

so we pattern rhyme

into lines we wind

to tell our story

of life unfolding

Darling, you have such beautiful tears

let's shed our fears

the earth and motion

Humanity's an ocean

surrender to devotion

give in to your dreams

question the way things seem

we want the world to teem with dreams

linguistic mystics permeate my statistics

alignment sans confinement

entwinement, rewind it

find a star and keep it

fill your life with

plightless kindness

take the world and redefine it
