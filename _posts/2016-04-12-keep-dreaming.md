# Keep Dreaming

I dance alone and countlessly wonder

if you're as confused as I am

I want to fall in love again

I want to find your gaze

and feel violated and connected

and be confused about what it is you mean

and what you mean to me

it's all some sultry dream.

I want your kisses again

I want you in my dreams again.
